## Overview

This is a console-based Job Scheduling System written in C++.  
It allows the user to:

- Add jobs with a name and priority
- Process jobs using **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- Process jobs using **Priority Scheduling**
- View jobs in the FCFS or Priority queue
- Automatically log completed jobs to a file

The project demonstrates core C++ concepts like **classes, queues, priority queues, and file handling**.
